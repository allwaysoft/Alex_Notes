A SQL tuning set (STS) is a database object that stores SQL statements along with their execution context.

SQL TUNING Advisor output:

	Advice on optimizing the execution plan

	Rationale for the proposed optimization

	Estimated performance benefit

	SQL statement to implement the advice
	
	The benefit percentage shown for each recommendation is calculated using the following formula:

	abnf% = (time_old - time_new)/(time_old)
	
	自动化的，如果设置允许，STA会自动应用sql profiles, 如果是手工，则绝对不会自动implements sql profiles
