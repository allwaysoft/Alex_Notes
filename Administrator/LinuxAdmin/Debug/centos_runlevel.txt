Description: runlevel returns unknown

	[root@azheng ~]# runlevel
	unknown


Cause: One job stucked during boot,so boot is incomplete

	[root@azheng ~]# systemctl list-jobs
	JOB UNIT                                 TYPE  STATE
	104 multi-user.target                    start waiting
	208 systemd-update-utmp-runlevel.service start waiting
	103 graphical.target                     start waiting
	218 plymouth-quit-wait.service           start running
	276 systemd-readahead-done.timer         start waiting

Solution: restart gdm service and the queued jobs are running

	[root@azheng ~]# systemctl restart gdm

	[root@azheng ~]# systemctl list-jobs
	No jobs running.

	[root@azheng ~]# runlevel
	N 5
