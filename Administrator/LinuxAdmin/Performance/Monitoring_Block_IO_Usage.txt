		%util is the percentage of CPU time spent handling I/O requests to a device
	
		avgqu-sz is the average queue length of I/O requests that were issued to that device
	
		*Conclusion:If %util approaches 100% or avgqu-sz is greater than 1, device saturation is occurring.		
		
#iotop utility can help you identify which processes are responsible for excessive disk I/O(Requires iotop package)

	iotop has the similar interface to top utility
	
		left and right arrow keys to change the sort field
