#memory utilization statistics
	
	sar -r
	
		%memused is the percentage of physical memory in use
	
#memory paging statistics

	sar -B
	
		pgscank/s is the number of memory pages scanned by the kswapd daemon per second
	 
		pgscand/s is the number of memory pagesscanned directly per second

#swapping statistics

	sar -W
		
		 pswpin/s and pswpout/s, which are the numbers of pages per second swapped in and out per second.

#Conclusion
	*If %memused is near 100% and the scan rate is continuously over 200 pages per second, the system has a memory shortage	
	
	*Out of physcial memory, performance degrade

	*Out of swap space, OS or Application are likely to crash

	If free or top indicate that little swap space remains available, this is also an indication you are running low on memory.

	The output from the dmesg command might include notification of any problems with physical memory that were detected at boot time.
