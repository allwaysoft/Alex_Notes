#CPU usage statistics for each CPU core and averaged across all CPU cores
	
	--command--
	mpstat -P ALL
	
	sar -u -P ALL
	--command--
	
	if %idle is near 0%, that means CPU bound is hit.
	
	%system or %sys is for running system code, the usage should not exceed 30%
	
#Load Average	
	
	Load average represent running processes, waitting to run, and waiting for disk I/O processes on CPU cores
	
	It should be not over 2 times of total number of CPU cores over 5 and 15 minutes
	
	If the load average exceeds four times the number of CPU cores for long periods, the system is overloaded.
	
	--command
	
	1. uptime
		summary
		
	2. sar -q
		column runq-sz stands for run-queue size, it indicates CPU saturation
		column plist_size indicates total number of processes
		
	When CPU capacity is insufficient for the workload, run top or dstat to check the most expensive processes
	
	3. dstat --top-cpu --top-mem --top-bio(requries dstat package)
	the above dstat command shows which processes are using CPUs, memory, and block I/O most intensively
	
	4. top
	real-time display of CPU activity
	f - choosing column
	o - column location
	O - sorting based on one column
