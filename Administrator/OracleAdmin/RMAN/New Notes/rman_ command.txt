-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 Connect to database
	
	OS Authentication
		rman TARGET /
		rman target '"/ as sysdba"'
		rman target '"/ as sysbackup"'

	Password file Authentication
		rman target '"sdba@prod1 as sysdba"'
		rman target '"sbu@prod1 as sysbackup"'
		rman target sbu@prod1
	
	Connecting to Target and a Recovery Catalog from the System Prompt
		rman TARGET sbu@prod CATALOG rco@catdb 
		===> recovery catelog is a schema in other database contains rman metadata, usually it is stored in database control file
	
	Connecting RMAN to an Auxiliary Database
		% rman
		RMAN> CONNECT TARGET /
		RMAN> CONNECT AUXILIARY sbu@aux

		% rman target / auxiliary sbu@aux
		Usually it use with duplicate command to create a standby database
	
	Connections to CDB and PDB
		Usually DBA can connect to root (CDB) using
		rman TARGET /
		BACKUP PLUGGABLE DATABASE sales, hr; ==> Backup PDB,which has a lot of restrictions
		
		If you need to connect to a PDB only
		rman target c##bkuser@sales(need have sales in TNSNAMES.ora)

	Log
		% rman LOG /tmp/rman.log
		
	
2. RMAN Check syntax 

	% rman CHECKSYNTAX
	
	Then Enter the RMAN commands to be tested.
	
	% rman CHECKSYNTAX @filename ===> check the syntax in a command file 
	
3. RMAN Configuration

	SHOW ALL;
	
	SHOW RETENTION POLICY;
	SHOW DEFAULT DEVICE TYPE;
	
	# reset the configuration to default
		CONFIGURE BACKUP OPTIMIZATION CLEAR;
		CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY CLEAR;
		CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT FOR DEVICE TYPE DISK CLEAR;
	
	Specifies that backups go to disk by default. Database block size must be multiple of the phsical block size of the destinaton device
		CONFIGURE DEFAULT DEVICE TYPE TO DISK
	
		CONFIGURE DEFAULT DEVICE TYPE TO sbt
	
	overwrite the default setting by specify it clearly
		BACKUP DEVICE TYPE sbt DATABASE;
		BACKUP DEVICE TYPE DISK DATABASE;
	
	CONFIGURE DEVICE TYPE DISK BACKUP TYPE TO COPY; # image copies
	CONFIGURE DEVICE TYPE DISK BACKUP TYPE TO BACKUPSET; # uncompressed
	
	CONFIGURE DEVICE TYPE DISK BACKUP TYPE TO COMPRESSED BACKUPSET;
	CONFIGURE DEVICE TYPE sbt BACKUP TYPE TO COMPRESSED BACKUPSET;
	
	for channel, second conf will make first conf invalid
		CONFIGURE CHANNEL DEVICE TYPE DISK MAXPIECESIZE 2G;
		CONFIGURE CHANNEL DEVICE TYPE DISK FORMAT /tmp/%U;
	
	valid conf:
		CONFIGURE CHANNEL DEVICE TYPE DISK FORMAT '/disk1/ora_df%t_s%s_s%p';
		or ASM
		CONFIGURE CHANNEL DEVICE TYPE DISK FORMAT '+dgroup1';
	
	channel number should match tape or disk number,
	Failing to allocate the right number of channel adversely affect RMAN performance during IO operations.
		RMAN> CONFIGURE DEVICE TYPE sbt PARALLELISM 2;
	
	RMAN take care of control file and SPFILE backup, even the control file is lost, database still can be recoverable
		CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP ON;
	
	default string format c-IIIIIIIIII-YYYYMMDD-QQ
	IIIIIIIIII DBID
	YYYYMMDD timestamp
	QQ hex number
		CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT FOR DEVICE TYPE deviceSpecifier TO 'string';

	? stands for oracle_home /u01 lost may cause backup fail
		CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT FOR DEVICE TYPE DISK TO '?/oradata/cf_%F';

	? ASM location for backups
		CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT FOR DEVICE TYPE DISK TO '+dgroup1/%F';
	
	Reset the conf
		CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT FOR DEVICE TYPE DISK CLEAR;
		CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT FOR DEVICE TYPE sbt CLEAR;
