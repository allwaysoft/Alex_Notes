Replace one disk at a time!!!!!!!!!

Disk Details:

	/dev/sdx --> pd_15 --> /dev/mapper/HDD_E1_S15_716598244
	
	/dev/sdp --> pd_06 --> /dev/mapper/HDD_E1_S06_711988568

Step 1: Preparation on both nodes

		tail -f /var/log/messages
		
		tail -f asm log
		
		tail -f database log
		
		A shell window for OAKCLI, oakcli show disk pd_xx
		
		turn on the LED indicator, oakcli locate disk pd_xx on
		
Step 2: Disk Replacement

		Call Alchemy,ask guy to get the disk ready then confrim the disk need to be replaced

		oakcli locate disk pd_xx off
		
		*pull the disk out then wait 5 minutes, this gives the software enough time to remove old entries and prepare for a new disk
		
		insert the new disk then using oakcli show disk pd_xx, check the status of new disk
		
Step 3: ASM rebalancing 

		log in as root then su - grid
		
		. oraenv +ASM#
		
		sqlplus / as sysasm
		
			alter diskgroup DATA/RECO rebalance power 11
			
			*select * from gv$asm_operation
			*only no row return means the ASM rebalancing is done.
		
			(change it back)
			alter diskgroup DATA/RECO rebalance power 1;
		
		change the ownership of file under /dev/mapper/ on BOTH NODES
		
		first disk replacement: 
		
			cd /dev/mapper
			
			ls -ltr HDD_E1_S15_716598244*
			
			chown root:disk HDD_E1_S15_716598244p1
			
			chown root:disk HDD_E1_S15_716598244p2

Once everything is done, start over another disk replacement.
